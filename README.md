# Truck Power Draw Simulation

This program uses data provided by NREL regarding power draw for EV trucks for three different fleet types, each with a size of 100. This program allows for scaling of the data to fit any purpose, selection of data bound, and different charging types for each fleet. Sample outputs are provided.
